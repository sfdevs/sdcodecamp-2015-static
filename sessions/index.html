<p>Configuration management and orchestration are ways of easing the pain. This talk will introduce <a href="http://ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, an open source IT automation tool. It will cover some good uses, bad uses, wins, and pitfalls. General strategies for configuration management, applicable to tools like Chef, Puppet, and Salt, will also be discussed.</p>

Major features of the current version such as methods and status codes will be unaffected. Existing sites should just work with the latest version, but they can drop many of the old tricks they used to squeeze out performance like CSS Sprites and file bundling. This session will review the basics of what is being changed and how to best utilize the new protocol.</p>

Most of these obstacles have been addressed by the growing community of IoT manufacturers and developers. The main barrier to entry now seems to be a basic understanding of electricity and electronics. Reading a component's data sheet can be scary, and many people are just hopelessly confused when things like current, voltage and resistance become important to the fate of a project.</p>

<p>Having received my bachelor's degree in Physics, I learned more about electricity and magnetism and electronics than I ever thought I'd use. Now that I've been dabbling in IoT development, I've found that a lot of this information is proving very useful. In this session, I'll relay the basics of electricity and electronics to help make this part of the IoT world a little less intimidating.</p>

Right? 3D printing seems like something straight out of a science fiction movie, but is it everything we've dreamt it could be? In short, no. Not yet. Jumping in to 3D printing can be a very frustrating and disheartening experience, but with patience, and the right set of expectations, it can be a very fun and fulfilling device to have in the house or office. In this session I'll help equip you for your small step into the future, and share my experience with it so that you may learn from my failures and eventual success.</p>

The new PSR-7 specification defines these, allowing you to code to shared interfaces instead of specific frameworks. Additionally, strong, shared HTTP abstractions give rise to a concept called "Middleware," software that sits between a request and a response. Come discover how PSR-7 works, learn about common middleware patterns, and discover how the two will change how you develop in PHP!</p>

What's an interactive rebase and how do I squash commits? I have legacy code in SVN/Mercurial, how can I get it into Git while preserving commit history? If you want answers to any of these questions, come to my talk! We'll discuss making use of some of the more advanced Git features and how to use them to save time and make work easier. If we have time/interest, we may also touch on branching strategies and what approach makes the most sense for you and your team.</p>

                                                                                <p class="summary"><p>Clojure is a functional, general purpose, LISP style language originally targeting the Java Virtual Machine. With almost no syntax and sticking close to theoretical and mathematical models of computation, it can be hard for one to see how Clojure might work in the wild. We will review Clojure and some of its capabilities—then take a look at some of the gritty details when building a web application.</p>
