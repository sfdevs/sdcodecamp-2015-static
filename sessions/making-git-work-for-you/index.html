Why do I care about merge vs. rebase? I pulled some bad code from a coworker that broke everything! How do I use reflog to time jump back to the good state I was in before? What&rsquo;s an interactive rebase and how do I squash commits? I have legacy code in SVN/Mercurial, how can I get it into Git while preserving commit history? If you want answers to any of these questions, come to my talk! We&rsquo;ll discuss making use of some of the more advanced Git features and how to use them to save time and make work easier. If we have time/interest, we may also touch on branching strategies and what approach makes the most sense for you and your team.</p></section><footer class=main><a href=https://twitter.com/sdcodecamp class=twitter-follow-button data-show-count=false data-lang=en data-align=right>Follow @sdcodecamp</a>
