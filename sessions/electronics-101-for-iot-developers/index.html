Most of these obstacles have been addressed by the growing community of IoT manufacturers and developers. The main barrier to entry now seems to be a basic understanding of electricity and electronics. Reading a component&rsquo;s data sheet can be scary, and many people are just hopelessly confused when things like current, voltage and resistance become important to the fate of a project.</p><p>Having received my bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Physics, I learned more about electricity and magnetism and electronics than I ever thought I&rsquo;d use. Now that I&rsquo;ve been dabbling in IoT development, I&rsquo;ve found that a lot of this information is proving very useful. In this session, I&rsquo;ll relay the basics of electricity and electronics to help make this part of the IoT world a little less intimidating.</p></section><footer class=main><a href=https://twitter.com/sdcodecamp class=twitter-follow-button data-show-count=false data-lang=en data-align=right>Follow @sdcodecamp</a>
